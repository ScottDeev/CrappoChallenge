# Coding Challenge (React)
A coding challenge in which I practised my React skills along with other frameworks like Tailwind for the styling and Framer motion for the animations

## Technologies Used
1. React
2. Tailwind
3. Framer motion

## Things I learnt
1. I was able to learn more on how to build figma designs, extracting the neccessary content, icons and images
2. I was able to familarize myself more with the popular CSS framework - Tailwind
3. I was able to use Framer motion for animations
4. Learnt more about React file structuring to make my codes more reuseable and to obey the DRY principle

## Challenges in the project
1. Extracting design content to a separate js file and export was a little bit of work
2. Setting up Framer motions always was stressful
3. Using Tailwind had me going back and forth from its documentation.
